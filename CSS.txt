Floating layout

Flex-box Layout(adaptive)

Grid Layout



layout they are using:
1)Banking domain-flex box
2)shopping-flexbox and grid
3)college websites-flexbox/grid
Limitations of these layouts
1)float
❌ Not meant for complex layouts
Difficult to create multi-column or responsive designs.
Requires “clearfix” hacks to prevent container collapse.
❌ Poor alignment control
No easy way to center items vertically or horizontally.
No control over spacing or distribution.
❌ Layout breaks easily
Float elements can overlap or break when content size changes.
❌ Requires many hacks
clear, clear fix, and manual width settings make layouts brittle.
2)flex
❌ One-direction at a time
Flexbox handles layout in either a row OR a column — not both simultaneously.
Not ideal for entire page layout.
❌ Complex when scaling to large grids
Hard to create large, structured layouts like dashboards.
Items may wrap unpredictably.
❌ No control over row and column alignment together
You can align along the main axis or cross axis, but not a full 2D matrix.
❌ Performance issues with many items
Large numbers of flex items can cause rendering slowdowns.

3)grid
❌ Not supported by all legacy browsers
Older browsers (IE11 partial support) cause issues.
❌ Overkill for simple layouts
Using Grid when only one direction is needed can add unnecessary complexity.
❌ Learning curve
Concepts like line-based placement, template areas, and implicit grid can be challenging.
❌ Items may not behave intuitively
Auto-placement might put items where you don’t expect.
Explicit vs implicit grid areas can confuse beginners.
❌ Harder when content size is unpredictable
Grids may break if content grows beyond expected sizes.






Scripting

2)Server side scripting(button type=submit)connect to server
