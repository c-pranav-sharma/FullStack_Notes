JavaScript Functions and Events
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.
Statement Identifiers
JavaScript statements start with a statement identifier to identify the action to be performed.
Statement identifiers are reserved words (cannot be used as variable names or any other things).
