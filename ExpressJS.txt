ExpressJS

Key Characteristics:
Minimal and flexible
Unopinionated (you decide how to structure your app)
Lightweight and fast
Extensible through middleware
Huge ecosystem of plugins and extensions

Basic Routing
Routing refers to how an application responds to client requests to specific endpoints (URIs) using different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
Express provides simple methods to define routes that correspond to HTTP methods:
app.get() - Handle GET requests
app.post() - Handle POST requests
app.put() - Handle PUT requests
app.delete() - Handle DELETE requests
app.all() - Handle all HTTP methods
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 8080;

// Respond to GET request on the root route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request to the homepage');
});

// Respond to POST request on the root route
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to the homepage');
});

// Respond to GET request on the /about route
app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About page');
});

// Catch all other routes
app.all('*', (req, res) => {
  res.status(404).send('404 - Page not found');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
Error Handling in Express
Error handling in Express is done through special middleware functions that have four arguments:
(err, req, res, next).
Key Points:
Error-handling middleware must have four arguments
It should be defined after other app.use() and route calls
You can have multiple error-handling middleware functions
Use next(err) to pass errors to the next error handler
